# Complete CI/CD pileine

• Designed a Java Spring Boot app.

• Created a scripted Jenkins pipeline that builds and containerises the app.

• Used ECR to store Docker images, and EKS to deploy the image to a Kubernetes cluster.

• Jenkins pulls the code from GitHub, builds it using Maven, and runs automated tests.
